cronologue is a cron logger inspired by Vladimir Vuksan's cronologger,
but implemented differently. 

cronologue a wrapper that executes a command, capturing the stdout and
stderr streams produced, and logs a job record and these output streams
back to a central server. Job records and output files are recorded as
plain text files, and pushed to an apache web server via HTTP PUT.

The following items are captured:
- hostname the script ran on
- username the script ran as
- time started
- time finished
- job duration
- return code
- command line
- stdout stream (if any)
- stderr stream (if any)
