Cronologue
==========

cronologue is a cron logger i.e. a wrapper that executes a command, 
capturing any stdout and stderr streams produced, and logging a job 
record and these output streams back to a central log server. Job 
records and output files are recorded as plain text files, and 
pushed to an apache web server via HTTP PUT.

The following items are captured:
- hostname the script ran on
- username the script ran as
- time started
- time finished
- job duration
- return code
- command line
- stdout stream (if any)
- stderr stream (if any)

Cronologue is written in perl, and requires the following perl modules:

- Config::Tiny
- Digest::MD5
- Time::Piece
- IPC::Run3
- LWP::UserAgent

Cronologue includes an apache config for configuring apache to accept 
the job record and stream files, which requires apache mod_dav.

Cronologue also includes a web gui built using blosxom (included),
which requires apache mod_cgi.

cronologue is inspired by Vladimir Vuksan's cronologger 
(https://github.com/vvuksan/cronologger), which uses couch db to store
job records, and a simple php web interface.
